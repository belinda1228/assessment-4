1) What is the difference between a client and a server? In the HTTP protocol,
which one of these sends requests, and which one sends responses?
All the requests done by client will be sent to a server and when performance from a server is done, 
the answer or a responese will be send back the client side. Client side sends requests and server side sends responses.

2) What do we mean by a "route" on a server?
When we create a new username on a webpage, the following route begins.
The html webpage initiates axios request that sends to backend; then the server recieves the request
and triggers corresponding functions. That function most likely performs some tasks in database and then
when the tasks are done, status will be sent in an html form to the website.

3) The steps below de describe what happens when a user goes to
a URL like https://facebook.com/home in their browser, but are out of order.
Put them in the correct order from start to finish.

- The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter
- The user's browser displays the HTML it recieved
- The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
- The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
- The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
